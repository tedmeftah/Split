Split

Split selection to a new file (not mush but I find it useful from time to time).

Usage
=====

you can either **Right Click** and chose ***Split Selection to File***, or use the appropriate keyboard shortcut:
* ```ctrl+shift+alt+s``` on Linux
* ```ctrl+shift+alt+s``` on Windows
* ```super+shift+alt+s``` on OSX
